# Assignment 1

## Prerequisites: 
- variables: numbers
- program structure: loops, if/then/else statements
- functions: create a function, recursive call of a function

## Assignment 1-A
Write a function which takes one argument N and prints the first N Fibonacci numbers. 
Make sure you test your functions with inputs which make sense as well as inputs which do not make sense (e.g., Fib(-1), Fib("who"), ...) 
Specifically, note what happens if you make some common errors: 
- invoke the function with the wrong number of arguments (no arguments, three arguments, ...) 
- invoke the function with the wrong type of arguments (string, arrays) 
- invoke the fucntion with invalid value (negative number, extremely large number)
Make sure you write unit tests for the versions of the function which returns arrays and 

# Assignment 1-C
Prerequisites: arrays and dictionaries
Modify your fibonacci function to return an array with the first N Fibonacci numbers
Then, modify the function to return a dictionary mapping first N integers to their Fibonacci number F(i)
